## CSS - Cascading Stylesheets

* CSS is for styling websites to make them look pretteh
* CSS has two things:
    * Whichever piece of code is read last in the code will be displayed on the page
    * CSS has a hierachy - furthest away gets listened to first but can easily be overwritten

### Inline CSS
* Devil.
* The closest styling to a html element possible
* It isn't efficient
* It takes a lot effort
* Should only be used in gun-to-head situations

### Internal
* Something just a little bit down from the devil
* CSS inserted into the <head> of a html document with a <style>
* It is better than inline, it is more efficient than inline but only just for BIG websites

### External

* CSS stored in an external file:
    * Normally named either style.css or main.css
    * mobile.css, tablet.css, responsive.css, min.css, manyMore.css

* The beauty of external files is that you can pick and choose which one you want the page to use?

* HTML has IDs and Classes
    * Classes in HTML are NOT the classes from Python & JavaScript

* IDs and Classes are used to style particular elements on the page
