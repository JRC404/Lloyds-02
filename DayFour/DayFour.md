# Classes - OOP

## Four principles 

* Inheritance -> Python uses Inheritance
    * Inheritance is taking attributes and methods from a parent class and using them in a child class
* Polymorphism:
    * Methods with the same name completing different tasks
* Encapsulation:
    * Hiding data and methods from outside sources, such as other classes
* Abstraction
    * Having methods and variables without values, so you can populate elsewhere

## Inheritance

* Inheritance is taking from the Parent class and giving attributes to the child class
* We have two terms for Parent class
    * Parent
    * Base
* We have two terms for Child class
    * Child
    * Derived
